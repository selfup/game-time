The amazing game of Tron!

Travel back in time to the 80's where you can battle head to head as motorcycles traveling through
the tubes of the interwebs.

Play the game [here](http://selfup.me/game-time/)

Brought to you by Regis Boudinot and Zach Routhier.  The French Dream Team.

Built in JavaScript, jQuery, and NPM.
Tested with Chai and Mocha.

The goal of this application was to build the game of tron using ES6 and TDD the entire time before drawing a single thing on the canvas.  We enjoyed breaking out our logic into concise, readable code with single element responsibiliy. There were a ton of little quirks and very interesting challenges we had to overcome to complete the application and below are our blog posts highlighting just two of the challenges we overcame.
